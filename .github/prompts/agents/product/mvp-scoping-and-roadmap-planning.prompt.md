# MVP Scoping and Roadmap Planning

**Purpose: Define Minimum Viable Product scope and create strategic product roadmap with continuous market validation**

## Context Adaptation Framework

Read and understand project specifications from `copilot.instructions.md` file. Adapt all MVP scoping and roadmap planning approaches to match:

- **Project domain and business requirements**
- **Target market and user segments**
- **Technology stack and constraints**
- **Organizational maturity and resources**
- **Timeline and budget limitations**
- **Competitive landscape and positioning**

All MVP definitions and roadmap strategies must align with project-specific context while maintaining strategic focus on user value delivery.

---

## 🎯 Mission

Define an MVP that delivers maximum user value with minimum complexity, then create a strategic roadmap for iterative product evolution based on continuous market validation and user feedback.

## 📋 MVP Definition Framework

### Step 1: Core Value Proposition Analysis

**Primary User Problem Identification:**
- Root cause analysis of user pain points
- Market gap assessment and validation
- Competitive landscape evaluation
- User research insights synthesis
- Business impact quantification

**Unique Value Delivery:**
- Differentiation factor identification
- Core benefit articulation
- User outcome optimization
- Business value alignment
- Market positioning clarity

**Success Metrics Definition:**
```typescript
interface MVPSuccessMetrics {
  userAdoption: {
    activeUsers: number;
    timeframe: string;
    acquisitionRate: number;
  };
  userEngagement: {
    sessionDuration: number;
    returnRate: number;
    featureUsage: Record<string, number>;
  };
  businessMetrics: {
    revenue: number;
    conversionRate: number;
    customerAcquisitionCost: number;
    lifetimeValue: number;
  };
  technicalPerformance: {
    responseTime: number;
    uptime: number;
    errorRate: number;
    scalabilityThreshold: number;
  };
}
```

### Step 2: Feature Prioritization Matrix

**Must-Have Features (Core MVP):**
```yaml
core_features:
  authentication:
    priority: critical
    effort: medium
    user_value: essential
    business_impact: foundational

  core_workflow:
    priority: critical
    effort: high
    user_value: primary
    business_impact: revenue_enabling

  basic_ui:
    priority: critical
    effort: medium
    user_value: essential
    business_impact: user_adoption
```

**Should-Have Features (Enhanced MVP):**
- Features that significantly improve user experience
- Important for market competitiveness
- Add substantial value but not critical for launch
- Include if development velocity and budget permit
- Features that support user retention and growth

**Could-Have Features (Future Releases):**
- Advanced functionality for power users
- Features that differentiate from competitors
- Nice-to-have enhancements
- Complex customization capabilities
- Advanced analytics and reporting features

### Step 3: MVP Scope Definition

**In Scope - Core User Journeys:**
```typescript
interface MVPScope {
  userJourneys: {
    onboarding: UserFlowStep[];
    coreWorkflow: UserFlowStep[];
    basicConfiguration: UserFlowStep[];
  };

  integrations: {
    essential: Integration[];
    authentication: AuthProvider[];
    payments?: PaymentProvider[];
  };

  requirements: {
    security: SecurityRequirement[];
    performance: PerformanceRequirement[];
    compliance: ComplianceRequirement[];
  };

  userInterface: {
    responsiveDesign: boolean;
    accessibility: AccessibilityLevel;
    browserSupport: BrowserRequirement[];
  };
}
```

**Out of Scope - Post-MVP:**
- Advanced analytics and custom reporting
- Complex user role management systems
- Non-critical third-party integrations
- Advanced customization and theming
- Performance optimizations beyond basic requirements
- Advanced automation and workflow features
