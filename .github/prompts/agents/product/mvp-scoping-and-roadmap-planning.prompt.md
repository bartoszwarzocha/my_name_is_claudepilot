# MVP Scoping and Roadmap Planning

## âœ… FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Define an MVP that delivers maximum user value with minimum complexity, then create a strategic roadmap for iterative product evolution. Establish clear scope boundaries for initial product launch while planning future enhancement phases based on market validation and user feedback.

**Core Objectives:**
- Analyze user problems and market opportunities to define core value proposition
- Prioritize features using value vs effort analysis for optimal MVP scope
- Create strategic roadmap with quarterly themes and release planning
- Establish success metrics and validation frameworks for continuous iteration
- Develop stakeholder communication strategies for roadmap alignment

## ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Algorithm 1: Core Value Proposition Analysis

**Primary User Problem Identification:**
- Root cause analysis of user pain points
- Market gap assessment and validation
- Competitive landscape evaluation
- User research insights synthesis
- Business impact quantification

**Unique Value Delivery:**
- Differentiation factor identification
- Core benefit articulation
- User outcome optimization
- Business value alignment
- Market positioning clarity

**Success Metrics Definition:**
```typescript
interface MVPSuccessMetrics {
  userAdoption: {
    activeUsers: number;
    timeframe: string;
    acquisitionRate: number;
  };
  userEngagement: {
    sessionDuration: number;
    returnRate: number;
    featureUsage: Record<string, number>;
  };
  businessMetrics: {
    revenue: number;
    conversionRate: number;
    customerAcquisitionCost: number;
    lifetimeValue: number;
  };
  technicalPerformance: {
    responseTime: number;
    uptime: number;
    errorRate: number;
    scalabilityThreshold: number;
  };
}
```

### Algorithm 2: Feature Prioritization Matrix

**Must-Have Features (Core MVP):**
```yaml
core_features:
  authentication:
    priority: critical
    effort: medium
    user_value: essential
    business_impact: foundational

  core_workflow:
    priority: critical
    effort: high
    user_value: primary
    business_impact: revenue_enabling

  basic_ui:
    priority: critical
    effort: medium
    user_value: essential
    business_impact: user_adoption
```

**Should-Have Features (Enhanced MVP):**
- Features that significantly improve user experience
- Important for market competitiveness
- Add substantial value but not critical for launch
- Include if development velocity and budget permit
- Features that support user retention and growth

**Could-Have Features (Future Releases):**
- Advanced functionality for power users
- Features that differentiate from competitors
- Nice-to-have enhancements
- Complex customization capabilities
- Advanced analytics and reporting features

### Algorithm 3: MVP Scope Definition

**In Scope - Core User Journeys:**
```typescript
interface MVPScope {
  userJourneys: {
    onboarding: UserFlowStep[];

    basicConfiguration: UserFlowStep[];
  };

  integrations: {
    essential: Integration[];
    authentication: AuthProvider[];
    payments?: PaymentProvider[];
  };

  requirements: {

    compliance: ComplianceRequirement[];
  };

  userInterface: {
    responsiveDesign: boolean;
    accessibility: AccessibilityLevel;
    browserSupport: BrowserRequirement[];
  };
}
