# SonarQube Code Quality Analysis

**ðŸ¤– CHATMODE ACTIVATION**: This prompt automatically activates the `@reviewer` chatmode.
**ðŸ“‹ AGENT CONTEXT**: The activated chatmode will read .github/copilot.instructions.md and adapt to project requirements.
**ðŸ”„ WORKFLOW INTEGRATION**: All review and assessment tasks will be managed through integrated GitHub Copilot workflows.

## âœ… FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Establish comprehensive code quality analysis using SonarQube to systematically evaluate maintainability, reliability, and security standards across the entire codebase. Configure automated quality gates with technology-specific rules and thresholds. Generate detailed quality metrics, trend analysis, and actionable improvement recommendations. Integrate quality assessment seamlessly into development workflows with CI/CD pipeline automation.

**Context Integration Requirements:**
- Read and adapt to project specifications from `.github/copilot.instructions.md`
- Configure language-specific quality profiles and rules based on detected technology stack
- Scale quality standards and thresholds appropriate for project size and team maturity
- Align quality gates with business risk tolerance and development methodology
- Integrate quality analysis with existing development tools and workflows

## ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Code Quality Analysis Methodology

1. **SonarQube Configuration and Setup**
   - Parse `.github/copilot.instructions.md` for technology stack, quality standards, and team maturity level
   - Detect programming languages and frameworks to configure appropriate quality profiles
   - Set up language-specific analysis rules, coverage requirements, and quality gate thresholds
   - Configure project-specific exclusions, test patterns, and source code organization

2. **Comprehensive Quality Scanning and Analysis**
   - Execute static code analysis using technology-appropriate SonarQube analyzers
   - Collect test coverage data from project-specific testing frameworks and tools
   - Analyze code complexity, duplication, maintainability, and security vulnerability patterns
   - Generate quality metrics across reliability, maintainability, security, and coverage dimensions
   - Process historical quality data for trend analysis and improvement tracking

3. **Quality Gate Evaluation and Validation**
   - Apply configured quality gates with business-appropriate thresholds and criteria
   - Evaluate new code quality against established baseline and improvement targets
   - Assess pull request quality impact and provide development team feedback
   - Generate quality gate status reports with detailed failure analysis and remediation guidance
   - Coordinate quality validation with CI/CD pipeline integration and deployment decisions

4. **Quality Improvement Planning and Recommendations**
   - Analyze quality trends and identify systematic improvement opportunities
   - Prioritize technical debt reduction based on business impact and remediation effort
   - Generate targeted recommendations for code quality, testing, and architecture improvements
   - Create quality coaching materials and best practice guidance for development teams
   - Establish continuous quality monitoring with automated alerting and reporting capabilities

## âœ“ VALIDATION CRITERIA

### Code Quality Analysis Standards
