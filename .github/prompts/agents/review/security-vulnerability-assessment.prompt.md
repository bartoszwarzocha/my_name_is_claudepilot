# Security Vulnerability Assessment

**ðŸ¤– CHATMODE ACTIVATION**: This prompt automatically activates the `@reviewer` chatmode.
**ðŸ“‹ AGENT CONTEXT**: The activated chatmode will read .github/copilot.instructions.md and adapt to project requirements.
**ðŸ”„ WORKFLOW INTEGRATION**: All review and assessment tasks will be managed through integrated GitHub Copilot workflows.

## âœ… FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Conduct comprehensive security vulnerability assessment that systematically identifies, analyzes, and prioritizes security weaknesses across applications, dependencies, infrastructure, and containers. Generate actionable remediation plans with business risk context, compliance mapping, and resource allocation guidance. Establish automated security scanning pipelines with continuous monitoring and alerting capabilities.

**Context Integration Requirements:**
- Read and adapt to project specifications from `.github/copilot.instructions.md`
- Adapt security assessment methodologies to detected technology stack
- Scale assessment approach based on project size and business criticality
- Align security validation with compliance requirements and industry standards
- Integrate assessment findings with existing development workflows and CI/CD pipelines

## ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Security Assessment Methodology

1. **Project Context Analysis and Configuration**
   - Parse `.github/copilot.instructions.md` for technology stack, compliance requirements, and business domain
   - Detect available security tools and scanning capabilities in project environment
   - Configure assessment scope based on project scale and risk tolerance
   - Establish security baseline and measurement criteria

2. **Comprehensive Security Scanning Pipeline**
   - Execute Static Application Security Testing (SAST) using technology-appropriate tools
   - Perform dependency vulnerability scanning for package and library security
   - Conduct container and infrastructure security analysis for deployment environments
   - Run Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) for runtime vulnerability discovery
   - Implement secrets detection and compliance checking across codebase

3. **Vulnerability Analysis and Risk Prioritization**
   - Consolidate security findings from multiple scanning tools and sources
   - Deduplicate vulnerabilities and filter false positives using context analysis
   - Calculate CVSS scores and business impact assessments for each vulnerability
   - Prioritize vulnerabilities based on exploitability, business impact, and remediation effort
   - Map vulnerabilities to compliance frameworks and regulatory requirements

4. **Remediation Planning and Resource Allocation**
   - Categorize vulnerabilities by remediation approach and timeline requirements
   - Generate immediate action plans for critical security issues requiring urgent attention
   - Create systematic remediation roadmap with resource allocation and timeline estimates
   - Establish security metrics dashboard and continuous monitoring capabilities
   - Develop security improvement recommendations with cost-benefit analysis

## âœ“ VALIDATION CRITERIA

### Security Assessment Quality Standards

**Assessment Completeness (REQUIRED):**
- All application layers scanned (static code, dependencies, containers, infrastructure)
- Technology-specific security tools selected and configured appropriately
- Vulnerability findings consolidated and deduplicated across all scanning sources
- Business context applied to risk assessment and prioritization decisions
- Compliance requirements mapped to vulnerability findings and remediation plans

**Risk Analysis Accuracy (REQUIRED):**
- CVSS scores calculated accurately using industry-standard methodologies
- Business impact assessment reflects actual organizational risk tolerance
- Vulnerability prioritization considers exploitability, impact, and remediation complexity
- False positive filtering reduces noise while maintaining comprehensive coverage
- Risk communication appropriate for both technical teams and executive stakeholders

**Remediation Planning Effectiveness (REQUIRED):**
- Immediate action plans provide clear guidance for critical vulnerabilities
- Systematic remediation roadmap includes realistic timelines and resource requirements
- Security improvement recommendations align with project technology stack and constraints
- Monitoring and alerting systems enable continuous security posture management
- Success metrics defined for measuring security improvement progress over time

**Integration and Automation Success (REQUIRED):**
- Security scanning integrated seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines without disrupting development workflows
- Automated vulnerability detection and alerting systems operational and properly configured
- Security findings accessible through project management and issue tracking systems
- Documentation and training materials enable team adoption of security practices
- Continuous improvement process established for evolving security assessment capabilities
