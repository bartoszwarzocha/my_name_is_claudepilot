# User Research and Persona Development

**Agent: ux-designer**
**Purpose: Conduct comprehensive user research and create actionable user personas**

---

## Context Analysis

**Context Adaptation**: Read copilot.instructions.md to understand:
- **Business Domain**: Industry-specific user behaviors and needs (ecommerce, fintech, healthcare, saas, enterprise, iot)
- **Project Scale**: Research scope and methodology selection (startup/lean research, SME/moderate research, enterprise/comprehensive research)
- **Target Audience**: Primary user segments and demographic characteristics
- **Development Stage**: Research timing and integration with product development lifecycle

Based on this analysis, the UX designer will adapt research methods and persona development approaches to match project requirements and constraints.

## 🎯 Mission
