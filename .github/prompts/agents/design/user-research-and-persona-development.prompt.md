- **Development Stage**: Research timing and integration with product development lifecycle

**Deliverable Requirements**:
- Comprehensive user research findings with validated insights
- Detailed primary persona profiles representing key user segments
- Research-backed design principles and user experience guidelines
- Integration recommendations for development and business strategy teams

## ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

**Algorithm 1: Adaptive Research Method Selection**
1. Analyze .github/copilot.instructions.md for business domain, project scale, and user characteristics
2. Select appropriate research methodologies based on project constraints and requirements
3. Design research plan with participant recruitment, data collection, and analysis frameworks
4. Execute research using qualitative and quantitative methods adapted to project context

**Algorithm 2: Systematic Persona Development**
1. Analyze research data to identify behavioral patterns and user segment clusters
2. Prioritize user segments based on business impact and development feasibility
3. Create detailed persona profiles with goals, pain points, and behavioral characteristics
4. Validate personas with stakeholders and integrate with development and business workflows

**Algorithm 3: Research Integration and Application**
1. Translate persona insights into actionable design principles and development requirements
2. Create persona-driven user stories and acceptance criteria for development teams
3. Establish continuous validation processes for persona accuracy and relevance
4. Coordinate with business and development teams for persona-guided decision making

**Detailed Research and Implementation Guidelines:**

*For comprehensive research methodologies, persona development frameworks, and domain-specific approaches, the @ux-designer chatmode provides extensive implementation guidance adapted to the specific business domain and project scale detected from .github/copilot.instructions.md.*

## âœ“ VALIDATION CRITERIA

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- **Research Quality Standards**: Participant diversity across target segments with data saturation in qualitative themes
- **Persona Validation**: Stakeholder alignment achieved on persona accuracy and business applicability
- **Integration Effectiveness**: Design decisions align with persona needs and drive measurable improvements
- **Business Impact**: Feature adoption rates and user satisfaction scores improve for targeted persona segments

**QUALITY GATES:**
- Research methodology appropriate for detected business domain and project scale
- Persona profiles supported by validated data with stakeholder consensus
- Design principles derived from research translate into actionable development requirements
- Continuous validation process established for persona accuracy and market relevance

**FAILURE CONDITIONS:**
- Personas based on assumptions rather than validated research data
- Research methods inappropriate for project constraints or business domain requirements
- Stakeholder rejection of persona accuracy or business applicability
- No measurable impact on design decisions or development prioritization
