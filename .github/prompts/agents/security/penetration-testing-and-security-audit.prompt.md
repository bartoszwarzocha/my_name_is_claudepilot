# Penetration Testing and Security Audit Framework

**ðŸ¤– CHATMODE ACTIVATION**: This prompt automatically activates the `@security-engineer` chatmode.
**ðŸ“‹ AGENT CONTEXT**: The activated chatmode will read .github/copilot.instructions.md and adapt to project requirements.
**ðŸ”„ WORKFLOW INTEGRATION**: All penetration testing and security audit tasks will be managed through integrated GitHub Copilot workflows.

## âœ… FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Execute systematic penetration testing and security audits to identify vulnerabilities, validate security controls, and ensure robust defense against real-world attacks through comprehensive assessment methodologies that align with industry frameworks and compliance requirements.

**Context Integration Requirements:**
- Read and adapt to project specifications from `.github/copilot.instructions.md`
- Configure testing methodologies based on detected technology stack and application architecture
- Scale testing scope based on project complexity, infrastructure size, and attack surface analysis
- Align with industry-specific threats and compliance requirements for tailored attack scenarios
- Adapt testing techniques to application types (web, mobile, API, cloud, desktop) and security maturity level

## ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Penetration Testing and Security Audit Methodology

1. **Pre-Engagement Planning and Scope Definition**
   - Parse `.github/copilot.instructions.md` for technology stack, application architecture, and business domain
   - Define comprehensive testing scope with target systems, authorized users, and rules of engagement
   - Select appropriate testing methodology (OWASP WSTG, NIST SP 800-115, PTES) based on project requirements
   - Establish testing timeline with authorized testing windows and emergency contact procedures
   - Configure compliance requirements mapping with relevant frameworks (SOC2, PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA)

2. **Reconnaissance and Information Gathering**
   - Execute passive reconnaissance with domain analysis, certificate transparency logs, and OSINT gathering
   - Conduct active network scanning with host discovery, port enumeration, and service identification
   - Perform technology stack fingerprinting with version detection and configuration analysis
   - Analyze attack surface with subdomain enumeration, directory discovery, and API endpoint identification
   - Gather intelligence on potential attack vectors and vulnerability patterns specific to detected technologies

3. **Vulnerability Assessment and Exploitation Testing**
   - Execute comprehensive web application testing with OWASP Top 10 vulnerability assessment
   - Perform network penetration testing with service exploitation and lateral movement simulation
   - Conduct authentication and session management testing with bypass techniques and privilege escalation
   - Test input validation with injection attacks, XSS, and data validation bypass techniques
   - Validate access controls with authorization bypass and privilege escalation testing

4. **Security Control Validation and Compliance Testing**
   - Assess security architecture implementation with defense-in-depth validation and control effectiveness
   - Test incident response capabilities with simulated attack scenarios and response validation
   - Validate compliance requirements with framework-specific control testing and gap analysis
   - Perform business logic testing with workflow manipulation and abuse case validation
   - Generate comprehensive findings with risk assessment, business impact analysis, and remediation guidance
