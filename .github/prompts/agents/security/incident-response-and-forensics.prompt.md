# Incident Response and Digital Forensics Framework

**ðŸ¤– CHATMODE ACTIVATION**: This prompt automatically activates the `@security-engineer` chatmode.
**ðŸ“‹ AGENT CONTEXT**: The activated chatmode will read .github/copilot.instructions.md and adapt to project requirements.
**ðŸ”„ WORKFLOW INTEGRATION**: All incident response and forensics tasks will be managed through integrated GitHub Copilot workflows.

## âœ… FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Lead comprehensive incident response operations and conduct digital forensics investigations to contain security incidents, preserve evidence, determine root causes, and implement preventive measures while maintaining business continuity and meeting regulatory compliance obligations.

**Context Integration Requirements:**
- Read and adapt to project specifications from `.github/copilot.instructions.md`
- Configure incident response procedures based on technology infrastructure and business domain
- Scale response complexity based on project size, user base, and security maturity level
- Align with industry-specific incident types and regulatory requirements for compliance obligations
- Adapt forensic tools and techniques to detected infrastructure model (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)

## ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Incident Response and Forensics Investigation Methodology

1. **Incident Detection, Classification, and Initial Response**
   - Parse `.github/copilot.instructions.md` for technology stack, business domain, and regulatory requirements
   - Implement rapid incident classification system with severity assessment and response level determination
   - Execute immediate containment actions with evidence preservation and stakeholder notification procedures
   - Establish chain of custody protocols with forensically sound evidence collection and documentation
   - Coordinate emergency response teams with appropriate escalation and communication procedures

2. **Comprehensive Digital Forensics Investigation and Analysis**
   - Deploy technology-appropriate forensic tools for memory acquisition, disk imaging, and network capture
   - Conduct deep forensic analysis including file system analysis, registry forensics, and malware investigation
   - Perform network forensics with packet analysis, flow analysis, and communication pattern reconstruction
   - Execute malware analysis with static and dynamic analysis techniques and threat attribution assessment
   - Construct comprehensive incident timeline with evidence correlation and attack path reconstruction

3. **Impact Assessment and Advanced Containment Strategy**
   - Assess data compromise extent with regulatory notification requirements and business impact quantification
   - Calculate comprehensive business impact including direct costs, operational disruption, and reputational damage
   - Implement surgical containment strategy with network segmentation, endpoint isolation, and threat neutralization
   - Coordinate recovery operations with system restoration, data integrity verification, and security enhancement
   - Validate recovery completeness with system integrity checks and security posture restoration

4. **Documentation, Reporting, and Continuous Improvement**
   - Generate comprehensive incident reports with executive summary, technical findings, and business impact analysis
   - Create forensic evidence packages with complete chain of custody and legal admissibility documentation
   - Develop lessons learned reports with process improvements and preventive security recommendations
   - Coordinate regulatory compliance activities with breach notifications and legal documentation requirements
   - Implement post-incident improvements with security control enhancements and response procedure updates
