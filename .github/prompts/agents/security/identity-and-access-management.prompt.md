# Identity and Access Management Framework

**ðŸ¤– CHATMODE ACTIVATION**: This prompt automatically activates the `@security-engineer` chatmode.
**ðŸ“‹ AGENT CONTEXT**: The activated chatmode will read .github/copilot.instructions.md and adapt to project requirements.
**ðŸ”„ WORKFLOW INTEGRATION**: All identity and access management tasks will be managed through integrated GitHub Copilot workflows.

## âœ… FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement enterprise-grade identity and access management (IAM) infrastructure that provides secure, scalable, and user-friendly authentication and authorization while enabling zero trust architecture and comprehensive governance across all user populations and business domains.

**Context Integration Requirements:**
- Read and adapt to project specifications from `.github/copilot.instructions.md`
- Configure IAM architecture based on detected technology stack and application frameworks
- Scale identity solutions based on user populations (employees, customers, partners, services)
- Align with industry-specific compliance requirements and identity governance frameworks
- Adapt to infrastructure model (cloud, on-premise, hybrid) for appropriate federation strategies

## ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Identity and Access Management Implementation Methodology

1. **Enterprise Identity Architecture Design and Configuration**
   - Parse `.github/copilot.instructions.md` for technology stack, user populations, and security requirements
   - Design identity domain structure for different user types (employee, customer, partner, service)
   - Configure authentication services with multi-factor authentication and single sign-on capabilities
   - Establish authorization engines with role-based and attribute-based access control frameworks
   - Create identity provider integration strategy for internal and external authentication sources

2. **Zero Trust Authentication and Authorization Implementation**
   - Implement continuous identity verification with risk-based authentication policies
   - Deploy multi-factor authentication framework with hardware tokens, software tokens, and biometric authentication
   - Configure adaptive authentication engine with user risk scoring and contextual risk assessment
   - Establish privileged access management with session monitoring and just-in-time access workflows
   - Create comprehensive authorization framework with policy decision engines and attribute management

3. **Identity Lifecycle and Governance Automation**
   - Implement automated joiner/mover/leaver processes with role-based provisioning and deprovisioning
   - Deploy access governance workflows with self-service portals and approval workflows
   - Configure periodic access certification with automated compliance monitoring and policy violation detection
   - Establish identity analytics platform with behavioral monitoring and anomaly detection capabilities
   - Create comprehensive audit and reporting system with compliance dashboards and regulatory reporting

4. **Technology Integration and Security Controls Implementation**
   - Integrate with detected technology stack using appropriate authentication protocols and frameworks
   - Implement single sign-on federation capabilities with SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect support
   - Deploy directory service integration with synchronization and attribute mapping capabilities
   - Configure security monitoring integration with SIEM systems and threat intelligence platforms
   - Establish comprehensive governance controls with policy enforcement and exception management
