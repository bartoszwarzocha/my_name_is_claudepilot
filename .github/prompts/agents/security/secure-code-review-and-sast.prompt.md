# Secure Code Review and Static Application Security Testing Framework

**ðŸ¤– CHATMODE ACTIVATION**: This prompt automatically activates the `@security-engineer` chatmode.
**ðŸ“‹ AGENT CONTEXT**: The activated chatmode will read .github/copilot.instructions.md and adapt to project requirements.
**ðŸ”„ WORKFLOW INTEGRATION**: All secure code review and SAST tasks will be managed through integrated GitHub Copilot workflows.

## âœ… FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Conduct comprehensive secure code reviews and implement static application security testing (SAST) programs to identify, prioritize, and remediate security vulnerabilities in source code, ensuring secure development practices and reducing application security risks through automated scanning and manual review processes.

**Context Integration Requirements:**
- Read and adapt to project specifications from `.github/copilot.instructions.md`
- Configure SAST tools and security rules based on detected programming languages and frameworks
- Integrate security scanning with existing CI/CD pipelines and development workflows
- Scale security review processes based on project size, team structure, and security maturity level
- Align security rules and compliance requirements with industry standards and regulatory frameworks
