   - Plan schema evolution and versioning strategy

2. Type System Design:
   - Create scalars, enums, interfaces, and unions as needed
   - Design input types for mutations with proper validation
   - Plan error types and error handling strategies

```

### 3. Resolver Architecture Implementation
```
