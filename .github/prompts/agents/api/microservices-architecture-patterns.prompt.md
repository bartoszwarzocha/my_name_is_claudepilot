# Microservices Architecture Patterns

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Resilience and Reliability
- **Fault Tolerance**: Implement circuit breaker, retry, and timeout patterns to handle service failures gracefully
- **Load Balancing**: Design intelligent load distribution strategies across service instances and availability zones
- **Health Monitoring**: Establish comprehensive health checks and observability across the entire service ecosystem
- **Graceful Degradation**: Implement fallback mechanisms and partial functionality during service outages

### Distributed System Patterns
- **API Gateway**: Design centralized API gateway for routing, authentication, and cross-cutting concerns
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Implement asynchronous messaging patterns for loose coupling and scalability
- **Distributed Transactions**: Handle data consistency across services using saga patterns and compensating transactions
