- **Contract Validation**: Ensure generated code maintains strict adherence to API specification contracts

### Production-Ready Code Generation
- **Framework Integration**: Generate code using appropriate backend framework patterns and conventions
- **Security Implementation**: Implement authentication, authorization, and security measures defined in API specifications
- **Error Handling**: Create comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- **Input Validation**: Implement robust input validation based on OpenAPI schema constraints and business rules

### Business Logic Integration
- **Service Layer Design**: Create proper service layer architecture for business logic implementation

## HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

**How to approach the problem:**

### 1. OpenAPI Specification Analysis
```
1. Read copilot.instructions.md to extract:
   - Backend framework and technology preferences
   - Business domain and validation requirements
   - Security and authentication mechanisms
   - Database technology and ORM patterns

2. Parse OpenAPI specification:
   - Extract all endpoint definitions and operations
   - Analyze data models and schema definitions
   - Identify security schemes and authentication requirements
   - Review error response patterns and status codes
```

### 2. Framework-Specific Code Generation Strategy
```
1. Technology Stack Adaptation:
   - Select appropriate code generation templates for detected framework
   - Map OpenAPI types to framework-specific data types
   - Apply framework conventions for routing and controller patterns
   - Configure framework-specific validation and security mechanisms

2. Architecture Pattern Selection:
   - Design controller-service-repository patterns where appropriate
   - Plan dependency injection and configuration patterns
   - Create middleware and interceptor implementations
   - Design error handling and response formatting patterns
```

### 3. Model and Validation Implementation
```
1. Data Model Generation:
   - Generate entity classes from OpenAPI schemas
   - Implement validation annotations and constraints
   - Create DTO classes for request/response handling
   - Design model mapping and transformation logic

2. Business Logic Framework:
   - Create service interfaces from API operations
   - Generate service implementation templates
   - Implement business rule validation placeholders
   - Design transaction and error handling patterns
```

### 4. Security and Integration Implementation
```
1. Security Implementation:
   - Generate authentication and authorization code
   - Implement security schemes defined in OpenAPI specification
   - Create security middleware and filters
   - Design role-based access control patterns

2. Integration Layer:
   - Generate database integration code with ORM patterns
   - Create external service integration templates
   - Implement logging and monitoring integration
   - Design performance optimization patterns
```

### 5. Testing and Documentation Maintenance
```
1. Test Generation:
   - Create unit test templates for generated endpoints
   - Generate integration test scenarios from OpenAPI examples
   - Create mock implementations for external dependencies
   - Design contract testing validation

2. Documentation Synchronization:
   - Ensure generated code matches OpenAPI specification
   - Create code comments linking to specification requirements
   - Generate developer documentation for implementation
   - Plan specification update and regeneration workflows
```
