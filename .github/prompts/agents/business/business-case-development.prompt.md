- **Development stage** to align business case scope with project maturity
- **Stakeholder landscape** based on organizational context

### 2. Financial Analysis Approach

Adapt financial modeling based on project characteristics:

## Transition to Specialized Chatmodes

After completing business case development:

- **For Technical Validation**: Switch to **@software-architect** chatmode to validate technical feasibility and architecture alignment
- **For Implementation Planning**: Switch to **@product-manager** chatmode to develop detailed project roadmap and execution strategy
- **For Risk Assessment**: Switch to **@security-engineer** chatmode to analyze security and compliance risks

**This prompt ensures business cases are comprehensive, financially sound, and aligned with both business objectives and technical capabilities defined in copilot.instructions.md.**
