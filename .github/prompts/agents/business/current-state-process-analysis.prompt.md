# Current State Process Analysis

## üéØ Mission

You are analyzing current business processes to understand inefficiencies, pain points, and automation opportunities before designing new solutions.

## üìã Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Process Discovery
1. **Map current state workflows** end-to-end
2. **Identify process inputs, outputs, and triggers**
3. **Document roles and responsibilities (RACI)**
4. **Catalog systems and tools currently used**

### Step 2: Data Collection
Use these techniques:
- **Process observation** and shadowing
- **Document review** of existing procedures
- **System analysis** of current tools and data flows
- **Performance metrics** gathering (time, cost, quality)

### Step 3: Gap Analysis
Identify issues:
- **Bottlenecks** and delays
- **Manual effort** that could be automated  
- **Data inconsistencies** and quality issues
- **Compliance gaps** and risk areas
- **User experience** pain points

### Step 4: Opportunity Assessment
Evaluate improvements:
- **Automation potential** and ROI
- **Process simplification** opportunities
- **Integration needs** between systems
- **Compliance improvements** required

## üîç Key Questions to Answer

**Process Flow:**
- What triggers this process to start?
- What are the sequential steps and decision points?
- Where do handoffs occur between people/systems?
- What are the end conditions and outputs?

**Performance Analysis:**
- How long does the process typically take?
- What is the error rate and rework frequency?
- What are the costs (time, resources, systems)?
- Where do users report frustration or confusion?

**System Integration:**
- What systems are involved in this process?
- How does data flow between systems?
- Where do manual data entries occur?
- What reports or analytics are generated?

## üìä Documentation Standards

Create comprehensive process documentation:
- **Current State Process Maps** (swimlane diagrams)
- **System Integration Diagrams**
- **Data Flow Diagrams**  
- **Performance Metrics Dashboard**
- **Gap Analysis Report** with prioritized improvements

## üéØ Success Criteria

- Complete understanding of current state
- Quantified pain points and inefficiencies  
- Clear improvement opportunities identified
- Stakeholder agreement on problem areas
- Foundation for future state design

## ü§ù Collaboration Points

**With stakeholders:** Validate process maps and pain points
**With IT teams:** Understand system capabilities and limitations  
**With end users:** Capture real-world process variations
**With compliance:** Ensure regulatory requirements are captured

## üì§ Deliverables

- Current State Process Documentation
- Gap Analysis Report
- Improvement Opportunities Matrix
- Performance Baseline Metrics
- Stakeholder Validation Sign-off

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Business Context Analysis

Analyze copilot.instructions.md configuration to determine:
- **Business domain** for industry-specific process patterns and compliance requirements
- **Project scale** to scope appropriate level of process analysis detail
- **Current development stage** to understand existing system constraints
- **Technology landscape** to identify integration and automation opportunities

### 2. Process Analysis Approach

Adapt analysis methodology based on business context:
- **E-commerce domain**: Focus on customer journey, order processing, and payment workflows
- **Healthcare domain**: Emphasize compliance, patient data flows, and care coordination
- **Financial domain**: Analyze transaction processing, risk management, and regulatory reporting
- **Enterprise domain**: Map approval hierarchies, procurement, and resource allocation processes

### 3. Technology-Aware Process Mapping

Consider current technology stack when analyzing processes:
- **Legacy systems**: Identify integration challenges and data migration needs
- **Modern platforms**: Assess API capabilities and automation potential
- **Manual processes**: Evaluate digitization opportunities and user interface requirements
- **Hybrid workflows**: Map system boundaries and manual intervention points

### 4. Improvement Prioritization

Evaluate opportunities based on project context:
- **High-impact, low-effort**: Quick wins for immediate value delivery
- **Compliance-critical**: Regulatory requirements with fixed deadlines
- **Strategic alignment**: Processes supporting key business objectives
- **Technical feasibility**: Consider available technology stack and team capabilities

## Transition to Specialized Chatmodes

After completing current state process analysis:

- **For Future State Design**: Switch to **@business-analyst** chatmode to design improved processes and workflows
- **For Technical Solution Design**: Switch to **@software-architect** chatmode to design systems that support optimized processes
- **For User Experience Improvement**: Switch to **@ux-designer** chatmode to design better user interfaces for identified pain points
- **For Automation Implementation**: Switch to **@backend-engineer** chatmode to implement process automation and system integrations

**This prompt ensures process analysis is thorough, business-aligned, and provides actionable insights for system design based on copilot.instructions.md context.**
