# Angular Services and Models Generation from Swagger Documentation

**ðŸ¤– CHATMODE ACTIVATION**: This prompt automatically activates the `@frontend-engineer` chatmode.
**ðŸ“‹ AGENT CONTEXT**: The activated chatmode will read .github/copilot.instructions.md and adapt to project requirements.
**ðŸ”„ WORKFLOW INTEGRATION**: All Angular code generation tasks will be managed through integrated GitHub Copilot workflows.

## âœ… FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Generate type-safe Angular services and models from Swagger/OpenAPI specifications that integrate seamlessly with Angular applications. Create production-ready code with comprehensive error handling, authentication integration, and maintainable architecture patterns.

**Angular Generation Requirements:**
- Parse Swagger/OpenAPI specifications and generate comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Create Angular services with proper HTTP client integration and error handling
- Implement authentication and authorization patterns for secure API communication
- Generate comprehensive validation and transformation utilities for API data
- Configure testing infrastructure for generated services and models
- Establish maintenance patterns for API specification updates and regeneration

## ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

**Phase 1: API Specification Analysis**
1. Read .github/copilot.instructions.md to understand Angular version, architecture patterns, and project conventions
2. Parse Swagger/OpenAPI specification to identify endpoints, models, and authentication patterns
3. Analyze existing Angular service patterns and HTTP client configuration
4. Plan code generation strategy based on project structure and naming conventions
5. Identify custom transformations and validation requirements for business logic

**Phase 2: Model and Interface Generation**
1. Generate TypeScript interfaces for all API models with comprehensive type definitions
2. Create enum types for API constants and status codes
3. Implement validation schemas and transformation utilities for data mapping
4. Generate request and response type definitions for all endpoints
5. Create utility types for pagination, filtering, and common API patterns

**Phase 3: Service Implementation**
1. Generate Angular services with HTTP client integration and dependency injection
2. Implement authentication patterns including token management and refresh logic
3. Create error handling strategies with user-friendly error messages
4. Configure request and response interceptors for common functionality
5. Implement caching strategies and offline functionality where appropriate

**Phase 4: Testing and Documentation**
1. Generate comprehensive unit tests for all services and data transformations
2. Create integration tests for API communication and error scenarios
3. Implement mock services for development and testing environments
4. Generate documentation for service usage and API integration patterns
5. Create maintenance scripts for API specification updates and code regeneration

## âœ“ VALIDATION CRITERIA

**Code Generation Quality:**
- Generated TypeScript interfaces provide complete type safety with zero 'any' types
- Angular services follow established patterns with proper dependency injection
- Error handling covers all API scenarios with actionable user feedback
- Authentication integration works seamlessly with existing security patterns

**Architecture Integration:**
- Generated code follows project naming conventions and architectural patterns
- Services integrate properly with existing HTTP client configuration
- Code generation process is repeatable and maintains consistency across updates
- Generated tests provide comprehensive coverage for API interactions

**Production Readiness:**
- Generated services handle network failures and timeout scenarios gracefully
- Performance optimization includes proper HTTP caching and request debouncing
- Security patterns protect against common API vulnerabilities
- Monitoring and logging provide adequate visibility for production debugging

**Maintenance and Updates:**
- API specification changes can be incorporated with minimal manual intervention
- Generated code remains compatible with Angular framework updates
- Documentation enables team understanding and consistent usage patterns
- Version control integration tracks generated code changes appropriately
