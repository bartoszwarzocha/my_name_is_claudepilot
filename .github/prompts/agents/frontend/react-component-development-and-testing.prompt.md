# React Component Development and Testing

**ðŸ¤– CHATMODE ACTIVATION**: This prompt automatically activates the `@frontend-engineer` chatmode.
**ðŸ“‹ AGENT CONTEXT**: The activated chatmode will read .github/copilot.instructions.md and adapt to project requirements.
**ðŸ”„ WORKFLOW INTEGRATION**: All React component development and testing tasks will be managed through integrated GitHub Copilot workflows.

## âœ… FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Develop robust, scalable React components with comprehensive TypeScript integration, modern architectural patterns, and thorough testing strategies. Create reusable, accessible components that follow best practices for performance, maintainability, and user experience while integrating seamlessly with modern React ecosystem tools.

**React Development Requirements:**
- Implement modern React patterns including hooks, context, and compound components
- Establish comprehensive TypeScript integration with strict type safety
- Create thorough testing strategies covering unit, integration, and accessibility testing
- Configure performance optimization with memoization and lazy loading
- Implement accessibility best practices with ARIA and semantic HTML
- Establish component documentation and design system integration

## ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

**Phase 1: Component Architecture and Design Patterns**
1. Read .github/copilot.instructions.md to determine React version, TypeScript config, and architectural preferences
2. Analyze project structure and existing component patterns for consistency
3. Design component architecture using appropriate patterns (compound, render props, custom hooks)
4. Implement TypeScript interfaces and types for component props and state
5. Configure component composition and reusability patterns

**Phase 2: Component Implementation and Optimization**
1. Develop components using modern React features and performance optimizations
2. Implement proper state management with hooks or external libraries
3. Configure memoization strategies for performance optimization
4. Establish error boundaries and error handling patterns
5. Implement accessibility features with ARIA attributes and semantic markup

**Phase 3: Testing Strategy Implementation**
1. Create comprehensive unit tests with React Testing Library
2. Implement integration tests for component interactions and workflows
3. Configure accessibility testing with axe-core and manual testing strategies
4. Develop performance testing for render times and memory usage
5. Establish visual regression testing for UI consistency

**Phase 4: Documentation and Maintenance**
1. Create component documentation with Storybook or similar tools
2. Implement design system integration and component variations
3. Configure automated testing pipelines and quality gates
4. Establish component maintenance patterns and refactoring strategies
5. Create component usage guidelines and best practices documentation

## âœ“ VALIDATION CRITERIA

**Component Quality Standards:**
- All components implement proper TypeScript typing with zero 'any' types
- Component props include comprehensive validation and default values
- Error handling covers all edge cases with graceful degradation
- Performance optimization maintains 60fps rendering under normal load

**Testing Coverage Excellence:**
- Unit test coverage exceeds 90% for component logic and user interactions
- Integration tests validate component composition and data flow
- Accessibility tests ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all components
- Visual regression tests prevent unintended UI changes

**Architecture and Maintainability:**
- Components follow single responsibility principle with clear separation of concerns
- Custom hooks extract reusable logic with proper dependency management
- Component composition enables flexible layouts and content structures
- Documentation provides clear usage examples and API reference

**Performance and User Experience:**
- Components implement proper memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Lazy loading strategies optimize initial bundle size and load times
- Accessibility features support keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Error boundaries prevent component failures from crashing the application
