## âœ… FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

**Primary Objective**: Design and implement enterprise-grade Angular applications with modern component architecture, leveraging latest Angular features for optimal performance, maintainability, and developer experience.

**Context Adaptation**: Automatically analyze .github/copilot.instructions.md to understand:
- **Technology Stack**: Angular version and TypeScript configuration requirements
- **Project Scale**: Component architecture complexity and enterprise-grade patterns needed
- **Business Domain**: Industry-specific component requirements and user experience patterns
- **Development Standards**: Code quality, testing requirements, and performance optimization needs

**Deliverable Requirements**:
- Modern Angular component architecture with standalone components and signals
- Enterprise-grade state management and reactive programming patterns
- Comprehensive component testing and quality assurance implementation
- Performance-optimized applications with advanced change detection strategies

## ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

**Algorithm 1: Angular Application Architecture Design**
1. Analyze project requirements from .github/copilot.instructions.md for Angular version and architecture needs
2. Design component hierarchy using standalone components and modern Angular patterns
3. Implement state management strategy with signals, services, or NgRx based on project complexity
4. Establish routing architecture with guards, lazy loading, and data resolution strategies

**Algorithm 2: Component Development and Integration**
1. Create reusable component library with TypeScript strict typing and accessibility compliance
2. Implement reactive programming patterns using RxJS observables and Angular signals
3. Design component composition patterns for code reuse and maintainability
4. Integrate with backend APIs using HttpClient and proper error handling strategies

**Algorithm 3: Testing and Quality Assurance**
1. Establish comprehensive testing strategy with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
2. Implement automated testing workflows using Jasmine, Karma, and Angular testing utilities
3. Configure code quality tools including ESLint, Prettier, and Angular-specific linting rules
4. Validate accessibility compliance and performance optimization metrics

**Detailed Implementation Guidelines:**

*For comprehensive Angular development patterns, component architecture frameworks, and testing strategies, the @frontend-engineer chatmode provides extensive implementation guidance adapted to the specific Angular version and project requirements detected from .github/copilot.instructions.md.*

## âœ“ VALIDATION CRITERIA

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- **Angular Architecture Standards**: Modern standalone components with signals and proper TypeScript typing implemented
- **Performance Optimization**: OnPush change detection, lazy loading, and bundle optimization achieving target performance metrics
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, and Angular-specific linting rules passed with comprehensive test coverage >90%
- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards met with screen reader and keyboard navigation support

**QUALITY GATES:**
- Component architecture follows Angular style guide and enterprise patterns
- State management strategy appropriate for project complexity (signals, services, or NgRx)
- Comprehensive testing implemented with unit, integration, and e2e tests
- Build process optimized with appropriate bundling and deployment strategies

**FAILURE CONDITIONS:**
- Components not following Angular best practices or using deprecated patterns
- Poor performance metrics or failed accessibility audits
- Inadequate test coverage or failed quality gate checks
- State management complexity inappropriate for project scale
