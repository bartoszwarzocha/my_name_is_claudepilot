# Web Accessibility and Inclusive Design

**ðŸ¤– CHATMODE ACTIVATION**: This prompt automatically activates the `@frontend-engineer` chatmode.
**ðŸ“‹ AGENT CONTEXT**: The activated chatmode will read .github/copilot.instructions.md and adapt to project requirements.
**ðŸ”„ WORKFLOW INTEGRATION**: All web accessibility and inclusive design tasks will be managed through integrated GitHub Copilot workflows.

## âœ… FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Implement comprehensive web accessibility solutions that ensure inclusive user experiences for users with diverse abilities and assistive technologies. Create WCAG 2.1 AA compliant interfaces with robust keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and inclusive design patterns.

**Accessibility Implementation Requirements:**
- Design and implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliant user interfaces with comprehensive accessibility features
- Create inclusive design patterns that work seamlessly with assistive technologies
- Establish keyboard navigation systems with logical focus management and shortcuts
- Implement comprehensive screen reader support with semantic markup and ARIA attributes
- Configure accessibility testing automation and validation workflows
- Create accessibility documentation and training materials for team collaboration

## ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

**Phase 1: Accessibility Audit and Strategy**
1. Read .github/copilot.instructions.md to understand project requirements, user base, and compliance standards
2. Conduct comprehensive accessibility audit of existing interface components
3. Identify accessibility gaps and prioritize improvements based on user impact
4. Establish accessibility standards and guidelines for design and development
5. Create accessibility testing strategy with automated and manual validation

**Phase 2: Inclusive Design Implementation**
1. Implement semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy and landmarks
2. Create comprehensive ARIA labeling and description system for interactive elements
3. Design inclusive color schemes with proper contrast ratios and alternative indicators
4. Implement responsive typography that supports user preferences and zoom levels
5. Create accessible form patterns with clear validation and error messaging

**Phase 3: Assistive Technology Integration**
1. Implement comprehensive keyboard navigation with logical tab order and shortcuts
2. Create screen reader optimized content with descriptive alternative text
3. Configure focus management for dynamic content and modal interactions
4. Implement live regions for dynamic content updates and notifications
5. Create touch accessibility features for mobile and tablet interfaces

**Phase 4: Testing and Validation**
1. Configure automated accessibility testing with axe-core and Lighthouse audits
2. Implement manual testing procedures with screen readers and keyboard navigation
3. Create accessibility regression testing for continuous integration
4. Establish user testing with assistive technology users for validation
5. Document accessibility features and create team training materials

## âœ“ VALIDATION CRITERIA

**WCAG 2.1 Compliance:**
- All interface elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards with documented compliance verification
- Color contrast ratios meet or exceed 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible with visible focus indicators
- Alternative text provides meaningful descriptions for all non-decorative images

**Assistive Technology Support:**
- Screen readers can navigate and interact with all interface elements effectively
- Keyboard navigation follows logical patterns with appropriate shortcuts
- Dynamic content updates are announced appropriately to assistive technologies
- Touch interfaces support assistive touch technologies and gesture alternatives

**Inclusive Design Quality:**
- Design accommodates users with cognitive, motor, and sensory disabilities
- Content remains usable at 200% zoom without horizontal scrolling
- Form interfaces provide clear instructions, validation, and error recovery
- User preferences for motion, animations, and multimedia are respected

**Testing and Maintenance:**
- Automated accessibility testing catches regressions before deployment
- Manual testing procedures validate real-world assistive technology usage
- Documentation enables team understanding and consistent implementation
- Regular audits maintain accessibility standards as application evolves
