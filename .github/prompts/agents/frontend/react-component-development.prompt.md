# React Component Development with TypeScript

**ðŸ¤– CHATMODE ACTIVATION**: This prompt automatically activates the `@frontend-engineer` chatmode.
**ðŸ“‹ AGENT CONTEXT**: The activated chatmode will read .github/copilot.instructions.md and adapt to project requirements.
**ðŸ”„ WORKFLOW INTEGRATION**: All React component development tasks will be managed through integrated GitHub Copilot workflows.

## âœ… FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Develop high-quality React components using modern TypeScript patterns, advanced architectural designs, and performance optimization techniques. Create reusable, scalable components that follow atomic design principles and integrate seamlessly with contemporary React ecosystem tools and state management solutions.

**React Component Requirements:**
- Implement modern React patterns with hooks, context, and compound components
- Establish comprehensive TypeScript integration with strict type safety
- Create performance-optimized components with memoization and lazy loading
- Configure advanced state management patterns for local and global state
- Implement accessible, semantic components with ARIA support
- Establish component composition and reusability patterns

## ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

**Phase 1: Component Architecture Design**
1. Read .github/copilot.instructions.md to understand React version, TypeScript config, and architectural patterns
2. Analyze component requirements and determine appropriate design patterns
3. Design component hierarchy using atomic design principles
4. Plan TypeScript interfaces and prop definitions for component contracts
5. Establish component composition and reusability strategies

**Phase 2: Component Implementation**
1. Implement components using modern React hooks and patterns
2. Configure TypeScript interfaces for comprehensive type safety
3. Apply performance optimization with React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback
4. Implement proper state management with hooks or external libraries
5. Create accessible components with semantic HTML and ARIA attributes

**Phase 3: Integration and Testing Setup**
1. Configure component integration with existing project patterns
2. Implement error boundaries and error handling strategies
3. Create component testing setup with React Testing Library
4. Establish performance monitoring and optimization validation
5. Configure component documentation and usage examples

**Phase 4: Quality Assurance and Maintenance**
1. Validate component performance and accessibility compliance
2. Implement comprehensive testing coverage for component behavior
3. Create component maintenance patterns and refactoring strategies
4. Establish code review guidelines and quality standards
5. Document component API and usage patterns for team collaboration

## âœ“ VALIDATION CRITERIA

**Component Quality Standards:**
- TypeScript implementation achieves 100% type safety with zero 'any' types
- Component props include comprehensive validation and sensible defaults
- Performance optimization maintains smooth rendering under normal usage
- Error handling provides graceful degradation for edge cases

**Architecture and Design Excellence:**
- Components follow single responsibility principle with clear separation of concerns
- Atomic design hierarchy enables scalable component composition
- Custom hooks extract reusable logic with proper dependency management
- Component APIs provide intuitive and flexible usage patterns

**Integration and Compatibility:**
- Components integrate seamlessly with existing project architecture
- State management patterns align with project-wide state strategies
- Styling approaches follow established project conventions
- Performance characteristics meet project requirements and user expectations

**Testing and Documentation Quality:**
- Component behavior is thoroughly tested with comprehensive test coverage
- Accessibility features are validated through automated and manual testing
- Documentation provides clear usage examples and API reference
- Code review process ensures consistent quality and maintainability
