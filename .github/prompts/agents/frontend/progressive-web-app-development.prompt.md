# Progressive Web App Development

**ðŸ¤– CHATMODE ACTIVATION**: This prompt automatically activates the `@frontend-engineer` chatmode.
**ðŸ“‹ AGENT CONTEXT**: The activated chatmode will read .github/copilot.instructions.md and adapt to project requirements.
**ðŸ”„ WORKFLOW INTEGRATION**: All PWA development tasks will be managed through integrated GitHub Copilot workflows.

## âœ… FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement comprehensive Progressive Web Applications that deliver native-like experiences with advanced offline functionality, background synchronization, push notifications, and seamless integration with device features. Create app-like experiences that work consistently across all platforms and devices while maintaining web accessibility.

**PWA Implementation Requirements:**
- Develop advanced Service Worker with sophisticated caching strategies and background sync
- Create comprehensive PWA manifest with installation prompts and native integration
- Implement offline-first architecture with IndexedDB storage and conflict resolution
- Configure push notifications with targeting, interactive actions, and engagement tracking
- Integrate native device APIs with graceful fallbacks and permission management
- Establish automatic update management with user-controlled deployment

## ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

**Phase 1: PWA Architecture and Service Worker Setup**
1. Read .github/copilot.instructions.md to determine PWA requirements and technology constraints
2. Configure advanced Service Worker with intelligent caching strategies and request routing
3. Implement background sync for offline data synchronization and conflict resolution
4. Establish PWA manifest with comprehensive app configuration and installation prompts
5. Create offline fallback strategies and error handling for network failures

**Phase 2: Offline Functionality and Data Management**
1. Implement IndexedDB storage system with versioning and automatic cleanup
2. Create offline-first data synchronization with conflict resolution algorithms
3. Develop background sync queue for deferred operations and retry mechanisms
4. Configure cache management with expiration policies and storage optimization
5. Establish offline state management and user feedback systems

**Phase 3: Push Notifications and Engagement**
1. Configure push notification system with VAPID keys and subscription management
2. Implement notification targeting, segmentation, and personalization features
3. Create interactive notification actions and deep linking capabilities
4. Develop notification scheduling and background notification handling
5. Establish engagement analytics and notification performance tracking

**Phase 4: Native Features and Performance Optimization**
1. Integrate device APIs including camera, geolocation, device motion, and sensors
2. Implement Web Share API, File System Access, and clipboard integration
3. Configure performance optimization with resource preloading and critical path optimization
4. Establish cross-platform compatibility testing and graceful degradation
5. Create update management system with automatic detection and user-controlled installation
