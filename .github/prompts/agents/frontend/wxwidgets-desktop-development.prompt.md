# wxWidgets Desktop Application Development

**ðŸ¤– CHATMODE ACTIVATION**: This prompt automatically activates the `@frontend-engineer` chatmode.
**ðŸ“‹ AGENT CONTEXT**: The activated chatmode will read .github/copilot.instructions.md and adapt to project requirements.
**ðŸ”„ WORKFLOW INTEGRATION**: All wxWidgets desktop development tasks will be managed through integrated GitHub Copilot workflows.

## âœ… FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Develop professional cross-platform desktop applications using wxWidgets with Python (wxPython) or C++ that deliver native user experiences across Windows, macOS, and Linux. Create modern GUI applications with advanced UI patterns, efficient data management, multi-threading support, and platform-specific integrations.

**Desktop Development Requirements:**
- Design and implement cross-platform GUI applications with native look and feel
- Create advanced UI components with custom controls and modern interaction patterns
- Implement efficient data management with MVC/MVP architecture patterns
- Configure multi-threading for responsive user interfaces and background processing
- Establish platform-specific integrations for file systems, notifications, and system features
- Create comprehensive testing and deployment strategies for desktop applications

## ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

**Phase 1: Application Architecture and UI Design**
1. Read .github/copilot.instructions.md to understand platform requirements, language preferences, and architectural constraints
2. Design application architecture using MVC/MVP patterns with clear separation of concerns
3. Create comprehensive UI mockups and user interaction flows for target platforms
4. Plan data management strategy with local storage, configuration, and user preferences
5. Establish threading architecture for responsive UI and background task management

**Phase 2: Core Application Implementation**
1. Implement main application framework with window management and navigation
2. Create advanced UI components using wxWidgets controls and custom implementations
3. Configure data binding and event handling for user interactions
4. Implement application lifecycle management with proper initialization and cleanup
5. Create comprehensive error handling and user feedback systems

**Phase 3: Platform Integration and Features**
1. Implement platform-specific features including file dialogs, system notifications, and taskbar integration
2. Configure application packaging and distribution for Windows, macOS, and Linux
3. Create user preferences management with cross-platform configuration storage
4. Implement clipboard integration, drag-and-drop functionality, and keyboard shortcuts
5. Configure accessibility features and internationalization support

**Phase 4: Testing and Deployment**
1. Create comprehensive testing strategies including unit tests and UI automation
2. Implement cross-platform testing procedures for consistent behavior validation
3. Configure continuous integration for automated building and testing across platforms
4. Create deployment and distribution strategies including installers and app store submission
5. Establish maintenance patterns for updates and platform compatibility

## âœ“ VALIDATION CRITERIA

**Cross-Platform Consistency:**
- Application maintains native look and feel across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- All features work consistently across target platforms without platform-specific bugs
- User interface adapts appropriately to platform-specific design guidelines
- Performance remains optimal across different hardware configurations and operating systems

**User Experience Quality:**
- Interface responds smoothly to user interactions with sub-100ms response times
- Application handles large datasets efficiently without UI freezing
- Error handling provides clear feedback with actionable recovery options
- Accessibility features support users with disabilities and assistive technologies

**Technical Implementation:**
- Threading implementation prevents UI blocking during intensive operations
- Memory management prevents leaks and maintains stable performance
- Data persistence works reliably across application restarts and system updates
- Platform integrations follow operating system conventions and security requirements

**Deployment and Maintenance:**
- Application installs and uninstalls cleanly on all target platforms
- Updates can be deployed safely without data loss or configuration issues
- Performance monitoring provides insights for optimization and debugging
- Documentation enables team development and user support
