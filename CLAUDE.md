# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

My Name Is ClaudePilot is a comprehensive GitHub Copilot framework for enterprise software development. It's a **derivative project** of the main [My Name Is Claude](../CLAUDE.md) framework, specifically adapted for GitHub Copilot ecosystem.

**Relationship to Parent Framework:**
- **Parent Project**: `/mnt/e/AI/my_name_is_claude/` - Advanced Claude Code Multi-Agent Framework
- **This Project**: `/mnt/e/AI/my_name_is_claude/my_name_is_claudepilot/` - GitHub Copilot adaptation
- **Core Difference**: Claude Code agents → GitHub Copilot chatmodes
- **Shared Standards**: Language, documentation, quality rules imported from parent

**Key Characteristics:**
- Multi-language support (TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, Go, Rust)
- Enterprise-focused with security and compliance built-in
- Technology-adaptive implementations
- Chatmode-based workflow system (GitHub Copilot specific)
- Inherits quality standards and rules from parent framework

## Core Framework Components

### Chatmodes (.github/chatmodes/)
12 specialized roles for GitHub Copilot Chat:
- **business-analyst**, **product-manager**, **reviewer** - Strategy & Planning
- **software-architect**, **ux-designer** - Architecture & Design
- **frontend-engineer**, **backend-engineer**, **api-engineer**, **data-engineer** - Development
- **qa-engineer**, **security-engineer** - Quality & Security
- **deployment-engineer** - Operations

### Prompts Library (.github/prompts/)
- **agents/**: 48+ specialized prompts organized by domain (api/, frontend/, security/, etc.)
- **workflows/**: 7 end-to-end orchestration prompts for complex projects
- **init/**: Project setup prompts (new-project, existing-project)

## Development Approach

### No Traditional Build System
This is a **framework/template project** - not a traditional software project with build commands. Instead:

- **Framework Usage**: Copy/adapt chatmodes and prompts to other projects
- **Content Updates**: Edit markdown files for chatmodes and prompts
- **Validation**: Use `.github/prompts/TESTING.md` for prompt validation
- **Quality**: Maintain enterprise-grade content standards

### Technology Adaptation Pattern
All components automatically adapt to:
1. **Project Type**: Detected from target project structure
2. **Technology Stack**: Read from `copilot.instructions.md` in target projects
3. **Business Domain**: Adapted based on project context
4. **Scale**: Startup/SME/Enterprise patterns

## Framework Philosophy

### Technology Agnostic Design
- Prompts work across React, Angular, Vue.js for frontend
- Backend support for Node.js, Python, Java, .NET, Go
- Database patterns for SQL and NoSQL systems
- Cloud platform adaptation (AWS, Azure, GCP)

### Enterprise Standards
- **Security**: OWASP compliance, threat modeling, security architecture
- **Quality**: Automated testing, performance optimization, code quality
- **Compliance**: SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS support
- **Governance**: Change management, audit trails, risk assessment

## Usage Instructions for Claude Code

## Inherited Standards from Parent Framework

### Language and Documentation Rules

#### **Mandatory Language Standards**
- **All framework files** (chatmodes, prompts, documentation) MUST be written in **English**
- **File and directory names** MUST be in **English**
- **Conversations with users** can be in **Polish or English** based on user preference
- **Technical terms** use English terminology even in Polish conversations
- **Framework components** remain in English regardless of conversation language

#### **Documentation Quantitative Information**
- **NEVER use quantitative information** in documentation (avoid "12 chatmodes", "48 prompts")
- **Use descriptive terms**: "comprehensive chatmodes", "specialized prompts", "complete coverage"
- **Exception**: Version numbers, dates, and technical specifications are allowed

#### **Directory Tree Documentation Standards**
- **ALWAYS verify actual filesystem structure** before documenting

```

#### **Forbidden Practices**
- ❌ **No Quantitative Information** - Avoid specific numbers
- ❌ **No Technology Lock-in** - MUST adapt to multiple stacks
- ❌ **No Hardcoded Implementations** - Use functional descriptions
- ❌ **No Overlap** - Each chatmode MUST have unique value

---

## Prompt Development Guidelines

### Functional Approach - Mandatory Rules

#### **Core Principles**
1. **Functional Descriptions Only**
   - Describe **WHAT** needs to be accomplished, not **HOW**
   - Focus on outcomes, requirements, success criteria
   - Example: ✅ "Implement user authentication with secure session management"
   - Anti-pattern: ❌ Specific React/Angular code without adaptation

2. **Technology-Agnostic Patterns**
   - Use general algorithms and architectural patterns
   - Avoid framework-specific assumptions
   - Example: ✅ "Create responsive component using framework conventions"
   - Anti-pattern: ❌ "Use React hooks and Material-UI"

3. **Configuration Adaptability**
   - MUST read `copilot.instructions.md` for project adaptation
   - Extract technology stack, business domain, project scale
   - Adapt behavior based on project specifications

#### **Mandatory Prompt Structure**
Every prompt MUST contain these 4 sections:

1. **FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS** - What needs to be accomplished
2. **HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS** - How to approach the problem
3. **VALIDATION CRITERIA** - What conditions must be met
4. **USAGE EXAMPLES** - For different GitHub Copilot scenarios

#### **GitHub Copilot Specific Adaptations**
- **Chatmode Integration** - How prompt works with specific chatmodes
- **Context Handoff** - Seamless transitions between chatmodes
- **GitHub Actions** - Integration with CI/CD workflows
- **Enterprise Features** - Security, compliance, governance

### Acceptable Code Examples
**Only when clearly marked as templates:**
- **Configuration Templates** - `[TEMPLATE - ADAPT TO YOUR PROJECT]`
- **Pattern Examples** - `[PATTERN EXAMPLE - CUSTOMIZE FOR YOUR NEEDS]`
- **Universal Utilities** - `[UTILITY TEMPLATE - ADAPT TO YOUR STACK]`

### Strictly Forbidden
- Hardcoded file paths without adaptation
- Rigid directory structures without customization
- Production-ready implementations without options
- Technology-specific commands without detection
