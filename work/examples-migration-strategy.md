# Examples Migration Strategy - My Name Is ClaudePilot

## Overview

This document defines the migration strategy for examples from "My Name Is Claude" framework to "My Name Is ClaudePilot" framework, focusing on adapting to GitHub Copilot's chatmode-based approach while maintaining comprehensive coverage of real-world development scenarios.

## Original Examples Analysis

### Source Examples (my_name_is_claude)
Based on `/mnt/e/AI/my_name_is_claude/work/examples.md` instructions:

1. **Desktop Book Writing App** (Python + SQLite)
2. **Angular Invoice App Migration** (Angular + .NET API, outdated Swagger)
3. **Complex Legacy Migration TDD** (ASP.NET + C++ → Angular + .NET, no documentation)

**Original Approach**: Claude Code agents with automatic orchestration

## Migration Strategy: "Copilot-Native Rewrite"

### Core Principles

#### 1. **Complete Rewrite vs Migration**
- **Decision**: Generate completely new examples optimized for GitHub Copilot
- **Reasoning**: Chatmode-based approach requires different workflow patterns
- **Outcome**: 3 new examples written from scratch for GitHub Copilot ecosystem

#### 2. **Chatmode-Centric Approach**
- **Original**: Automatic agent transitions with orchestration hooks
- **New**: Manual chatmode switching with explicit instructions
- **Implementation**: Each step specifies required chatmode and transition reasoning

#### 3. **GitHub Native Integration**
- **Original**: Claude Code CLI integration
- **New**: GitHub Copilot Chat integration with native workflows
- **Features**: GitHub Actions, Copilot Chat prompts, repository-native workflows

#### 4. **Enterprise Focus Enhancement**
- **Original**: Development-focused examples
- **New**: Enterprise-grade examples with compliance, security, governance
- **Addition**: Enterprise workflows, quality gates, audit trails

### Example 3: Legacy ASP.NET Modernization with TDD
**File**: `legacy-asp-net-modernization-tdd.md`

#### Key Adaptations:
- **Methodology**: Test-Driven Development with comprehensive coverage
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E testing for complete validation
- **Approach**: Big Bang migration with parallel system validation
- **Quality**: >95% test coverage with zero functional regression

#### Advanced TDD Integration:
- Playwright test specifications matching legacy behavior
- TDD API development with failing tests first
- Comprehensive E2E validation workflows
- Legacy behavior preservation through automated testing

## Key Differences from Original Framework

### 1. **Workflow Orchestration**

#### Original (Claude Code):
```bash
# Automatic agent switching with hooks
claude --agent business-analyst --prompt requirements-gathering
# [Automatic transition to software-architect]
# [Orchestration handles complexity]
```

#### New (GitHub Copilot):
```
# Manual chatmode switching with explicit guidance
Switch to business-analyst chatmode

@github .github/prompts/agents/business/stakeholder-requirements-gathering.prompt.md
Context: Desktop book writing application requirements

# [Manual transition with context preservation]
Switch to software-architect chatmode

@github .github/prompts/agents/architecture/desktop-application-architecture.prompt.md
Context: Cross-platform Python desktop application architecture
```

### 2. **Technology Integration**

#### Original Focus:
- Claude Code CLI integration
- Local development workflows
- Agent-based orchestration

#### New Focus:
- GitHub Copilot Chat integration
- Repository-native workflows
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Enterprise compliance automation

### 3. **Quality Assurance**

#### Original Approach:
- Basic testing coverage
- Manual quality validation
- Agent-driven QA processes

#### New Approach:
- Comprehensive testing frameworks (95%+ coverage)
- Automated quality gates in CI/CD
- Enterprise-grade quality assurance
- Performance benchmarking and validation

### 4. **Enterprise Features**

#### Enhanced in New Examples:
- **Security**: Built-in security scanning, compliance validation
- **Governance**: Enterprise workflow orchestration with approval gates
- **Monitoring**: Application performance monitoring, alerting
- **Audit**: Comprehensive audit trails and documentation
